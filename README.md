– Extended CBBA with a hybrid centralised-decentralised architecture: worker drones bid using a composite reward function weighting energy feasibility and fairness; the queen drone applies K-means clustering over assigned task paths to identify and self-assign the most central tasks, minimising its own travel distance and energy use. – Designed an energy-aware bidding function computing residual drone energy after each candidate path (hover and travel, 720,000 mJ capacity); fairness score is inversely proportional to tasks already won; drones at or below 10% battery stop bidding to reserve return energy. – Introduced dynamic queen re-election: on queen energy exhaustion, remaining drones enter a decentralised bid based on current energy; winner assumes queen role and resumes K-means-based central coordination. – Validated across 5 simulated scenarios and real-world coordinate maps using Monte Carlo methods and AirSim; queen drone travelled 6.76–13.7m vs 20–37m for worker drones, and fairness weight 0.9 achieved 14–15 tasks per worker drone vs as few as 1 in baseline CBBA
