# multi_drone_coordination

Abstract
Drones have emerged as versatile tools across various industries, with mapping en-
vironments being a prominent application. However, mapping extensive terrains
demands the collaborative efforts of multiple drones to efficiently accomplish the
task, owing to the limitations of a single drone’s energy resources. This challenge
is addressed in this study through the development of a multi drone task allocation
system. Drawing inspiration from the intricate coordination observed in honey bee
hives, the CBBA algorithm is extended to optimize energy consumption and task
distribution in multi drone missions. The central focus is on the queen drone which
acts as the coordinator and conserving energy for prolonged missions. By considering
individual drone energy levels during task allocation, energy shortages are prevented
and mission efficiency is enhanced. Moreover, fairness considerations ensure an equit-
able distribution of tasks among the drones. Through comprehensive evaluations,
the effectiveness of the extended CBBA algorithm in reducing the queen drone’s en-
ergy consumption while optimizing resource allocation is demonstrated. Empirical
evaluations showcase its applicability in diverse scenarios from marine surveying to
disaster response and wildlife monitoring. Significant contributions are made by this
research to the domain of multi drone task allocation operations, offering energy
efficient and fair task distribution solutions. By optimizing resources and extending
mission durations, This approach has potential to enhance productivity and sustain-
ability in various industries.
